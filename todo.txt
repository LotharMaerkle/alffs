next:
* cache housekeeping
* handle created and modified dated in stats and mtime calls
* delete sec. assocs if approbrate
* support hardlinks: hardlinks will become secondaries
* support symlinks: symlinks will become alfresco links


general:
* create a test exec
* provide debs

client and server:
* allow assoc driven projection of any store so that it can be used as a general powerfull read write node browser
* df in linux gives differnt sizes on avail (greater)
* always return errno on errors from alf
* show stat birth time
* API permissions call (and mapping)
* handle MLText properties in xattr set
* switch from paths to filehandles and let filehandles point to noderefs
* server side traversal fails if filename looks like a guid (PathUtils bug)
* add valgrind helper script
* curl ssl support options
* factor path and base checking out
* return bytes read and written
* support binary content for setxattr and getxattr for d:content type properties
* mimetype always octet-stream with rsync?
* logging levels
* write_buf so that > 4k blocks could be written to
* reuse curl handle to reuse http connection
* merge alf_open and alf_create
* add cache buster support
* add proxy support
 readdir could cache dirent with whole getattrs so that not a http call for each file has to be done
* use xattr user. prefix according to linux xattr semantics

postponed:
* use bson in favor of json --> no bson package in ubuntu yet, only as part of mongodb
* rsync:  mkstemp "/mnt/alf/test-1/AlfIO/config-repo/alfresco/module/ecm4u_io/.web-client-config.xml.GVR2SK" failed: Function not implemented (38) --> no support for mkstemp in fuse

done:
* reuse connections
* cleanup handle cache on exit
* refcounting opens
* directory handling mkdir, rmdir
* unkonw property ex with getxattr securiy.selinux -> EIO
* metadata as extended attributes
* listxattr just with keys
* speedup getxattr test for alf. prefix to avoid network roundtrip
* init all local vars on the stack
* open has to create a file so that following read or write is successful
* unlink segfaults
* statfs
* simple local caching:
* simple write optimization: download file on open, write data to local file, upload file on close 
* fuse set times API call
* rsync: failed to set times on "/mnt/alf/test-1/AlfIO/source/java/de/ecm4u/alfresco": Function not implemented (38)
* support libreoffice writer
* support libreoffice calc
* support libreoffice impress
* bug in rsync --inplace add extra control chars
* truncate refcounted opens local cache support
* track utimes at wip file and sync timestamps in final remote update in release
